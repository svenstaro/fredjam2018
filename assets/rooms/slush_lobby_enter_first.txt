In the corner of the slush lobby, a pale figure is sitting, leaned against the wall. "Thank god! I thought I was the only one." He is holding his side, there are some red smears on the wall behind him.
"Do you have any idea what happened?" he asks. "I was in the next room when the lights went out. Something attacked me in the dark. I managed to shut the door, but I couldn't stop the bleeding from its bite..." his gaze trails off into the distance.

A constant wind pushes against you, this room has pretty large ventilation shafts.

A solar storm has incapacitated most of the ships solar sails. You will need to power cycle the central cortex to reactivate them and resume cryosleep."
At one side of the room, you see a door with a label saying "cryocontrol". You hear faint rustling on the other side.
