In the corner of the slush lobby, a pale figure is sitting, leaned against the wall. "Thank god! I thought I was the only one." He is holding his side, there are some red smears on the wall behind him.
"Do you have any idea what happened?" he asks. "I was in the next room when the lights went out. Something attacked me in the dark. I managed to shut the door, but I couldn't stop the bleeding from its bite..." his gaze trails off into the distance.

"Dear Passengers," the voice that had to belong to the ship's AI started. "An unexpe-" backtracking, she started again: "I have found a way to route failover energy to your wing. Please report to the bridge for further instructions."
At one side of the room, you see a door with a label saying "cryocontrol". You here faint rustling on the other side.
