# story - rooms & intro texts

## cryobay
You wake up with your eyes closed. You're tired and your bones ache in the way they do after a long, long slumber. Yawning, you struggle to open your eyelids. They feel heavy.

"Welcome to the cryobay of the SC Cyclone. You have been woken up from cryosleep following standard emergency procedure. Please remain calm and stay in your casket."
You hear a woman speak in a friendly, but slightly faltering voice. Through blurry eyes, you begin to see the room your casket is standing in. You see no signs of the woman.
"Who am I?" you mutter, feeling a small jolt of panic from somewhere in the back of your chest.
"This behaviour is to be expected. Your early readouts show signs of thawing amnesia - Your memories should come back to you soon."
The glass in front of you hisses as it slides away into the sides of your casket.
You step out into a dimly lit room. It is full of other, empty cryosleep caskets.
