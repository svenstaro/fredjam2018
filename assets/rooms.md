## cryobay
You wake up with your eyes closed. You're tired and your bones ache in the way they do after a long, long slumber. Yawning, you struggle to open your eyelids. They feel heavy.

"Welcome to the cryobay of the SC Cyclone. You have been woken up from cryosleep following standard emergency procedure. Please remain calm and stay in your casket."
You hear a woman speak in a friendly, but slightly faltering voice. Through blurry eyes, you begin to see the room your casket is standing in. There are no signs of the woman you just heard.
"Who am I?" you mutter, feeling a small jolt of panic from somewhere in the back of your chest.
"This behaviour is to be expected. Your early readouts show signs of thawing amnesia - Your memories should come back to you soon."
The glass in front of you hisses as it slides away into the sides of your casket.
You step out into a dimly lit room. It is full of other, empty cryosleep caskets.
"Your name is-" the voice stops abrubtly, "Your-" a short pause - "Your personal records are inavailable at the moment. Contact the bridge to obtain additional information."
A door at the other side of the room slides open.
"Please proceed to the slush lobby."

## slush lobby
In the corner of the slush lobby, a pale figure is sitting, leaned against the wall. "Thank god! I thought I was the only one." He is holding his side, there are some red smears on the wall behind him.
"Do you have any idea what happened?" he asks. "I was in the next room when the lights went out. Something attacked me in the dark. I managed to shut the door, but I couldn't stop the bleeding from its bite..." his gaze trails off into the distance.

"Dear Passengers," the voice that had to belong to the ship's AI started. "An unexpe-" backtracking, she started again: "I have found a way to route failover energy to your wing. Please report to the bridge for further instructions."
At one side of the room, you see a door with a label saying "cryocontrol". You here faint rustling on the other side.

## cryocontrol
You press the 'open' button next to the door to cryocontrol. The door vanishes, revealing a room bathed in red light. There are holos on the walls, some frantically flashing, some showing rapidly jumping readouts of cryo devices.
